        <item>The Hare ran down the road for a while and then and paused to rest. </item>
        <item>He looked back at the tortoise and cried out, "How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?"</item>
        <item>The Hare stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, "There is plenty of time to relax."</item>
        <item>The Tortoise walked and walked; never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.</item>
        <item>The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise, that they woke up Hare. </item>

        <item>"Pardon, O King!" cried the little Mouse, "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!”</item>
